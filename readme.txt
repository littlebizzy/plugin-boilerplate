#### The Long Version ####

Here you can place a longer description of the plugin and its features, separated into paragraphs.

    code snippet is indented with four spaces;

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on LEMP (Nginx) web servers with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and security reasons, we highly recommend against using WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

Note: Any WordPress plugin may also be loaded as "Must-Use" by using the [Autoloader](https://github.com/littlebizzy/autoloader) script within the `mu-plugins` directory.

#### Defined Constants ####

The following defined constants are supported by this plugin:

* `define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);`

Why no quotes? Adding quotes evaluates the 'false' or "false" values as a string, and the boolean evaluation of any string returns true (except for empty strings).

It is a little bit weird but PHP works this way because it does not require strong data typing. There are special operatos (the triple equality ===) to ensure the right data type, but adds complexity and it is used normally where you are not sure of the input variable data type.

It is true that there are constants that expects both boolean and string values, but the important thing here is that the false value does not contain quotes, e.g.:

define('DISABLE_CART_FRAGMENTS', true);
define('DISABLE_CART_FRAGMENTS', false);
define('DISABLE_CART_FRAGMENTS', '123,456,789');

### Philosophy ####

Inspired by the likes of Unix and W. Edwards Deming, we believe in creating high quality software "components" that can stand on their own, or be integrated into other software. At a certain point, this approach has practical limits, which is why we are beginning to combine certain features into premium plugins. Still, we aim to reduce redundancy wherever possible, and present a unified UI in our premium plugins that in fact combines multiple small indepdent functions behind the scenes.
